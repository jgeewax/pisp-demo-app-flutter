# MojaPay

## Introduction

[Mojapay](https://github.com/mojaloop/pisp-demo-app-flutter) was developed to demonstrate the ability of Mojaloop to make end to end transfers. It's a payment initiation app, which allows people to send money to one another. The basic features of the app are

1. Login/Authentication
2. Account Linking
3. Dashboard
4. Transfers

The goal of this document is to serve as a good starting point for someone onboarding onto Mojapay. The document talks about the architecture, design and decisions made in the app and also how one might proceed to add a new feature.

## Warning: As of now, only Android is supported!

## Tech Stack

1. Mojapay uses flutter for the frontend and uses firebase as a datastore and for authentication.
2. We use [Get](https://pub.dev/packages/get) for state management. Thanks to Get, we have great separation of concerns in our codebase and it vastly reduces the verbosity of flutter syntax.

## Local Setup

1. Clone [this](https://github.com/mojaloop/pisp-demo-app-flutter) repository.
2. [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) the flutter sdk.
3. [Install](https://developer.android.com/studio/install) Android Studio.
4. Install flutter and dart plugin on android studio. Go to `File->Settings->Plugins` (Windows) or `Android Studio -> Preferences->Plugins(Mac)` and install the flutter plugin.
5. Clone the repository and open the **root directory** from Android Studio
6. Go to `Settings -> Flutter` (Windows) `Android Studio -> Preferences -> Languages & Frameworks -> Flutter` (Mac)  and add the path to flutter SDK if not already present.
7. Get your google-services.json from firebase. Follow the steps [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/flutter-firebase-setup) This is necessary to build the app successfully.
8. Connect device/ emulator and run the app.


[ TODO: configure sign in]


```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```


8. Make sure you enter the app's SHA-1 fingerprint under the [Settings page](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/_/settings/general) of your Firebase console as this is required to ensure that Google sign-in functions properly. You can get the app's debug SHA-1 fingerprint by running this command: `keytool -list -v -alias androiddebugkey -keystore %USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore`.
9. Connect device/ emulator and run the app.


### Local Setup - Flutter Web

1. Make sure you have flutter web enabled. See [this guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web) for steps
2. Ensure that `flutter devices` outputs the following:

```
1 connected device:

Chrome (web) • chrome • web-javascript • Google Chrome 88.0.4324.182
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:mojaloop/pisp-demo-app-flutter.git
cd pisp-demo-app-flutter
flutter run -d chrome --web-port 5000
```

## Deploying - Web

We need to set up firebase (only once)
```bash
# release to the firebase project
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init

# select the following options:
# existing project
# mojapay-dev
# build/web
# rewrite - Yes
# automatic builds - No
# overwrite web/index.html - No
```

```bash
# First, make sure we have the correct fido2_client
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/mojaloop/fido2-client-plugin fido2_client

cd pisp_demo_app_flutter
flutter build web
firebase deploy
```

Now go to https://mojapay-dev.web.app to see it live!

## JSON Serialization

To generate the files that handle JSON encoding/decoding for model objects (e.g. consent.g.dart), run `flutter pub run build_runner build` in the project directory.

## Flutter handy snippets


```bash
# upgrade dependencies
flutter pub upgrade

# rebuild generated files
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# specify a flutter version to use
flutter version v1.9.1+hotfix.3

# rebuild the generated files:

flutter pub run build_runner build
```
